# Cool Card Games

## Overview
### Summary
Cool Card Games seeks to bring card games to users in a simple, easy-to-use, fun, customizable interface. Cool Card Games at the start will support five different card games - Euchre, Poker, Go Fish, Solitaire, and a game unique to Cool Card Games entitled Bruh. Each game will be available in the same application, allowing for consistent themes, controls, etc. between the games. For more details, see our [Design Document](https://github.com/SeanCThomas0/CS307_cool_card_games/files/10263979/Design.Document.pdf).

### Purpose of Program
The program was developed not only to provide entertainment via card games, but to challenge ourselves to use new technologies and programming languages while following a scrum methodology.

### What was Learned
For the group, this was everyone's first time developing an application utilizing Unity. Given Unity utilizes C#, this was also everyone's first time utilizing C#. Additionally, for many of us, this was our first time utilizing authentication and a third-party database in a project of our own, as we used Firebase. For a few, this was their first time following a scrum methodology.

### Features
- Five Card Games: Go Fish, Euchre, Solitaire, Poker, and Bruh (a card game unique to our application)
- A rules page for each of the five card games
- User profiles with an editable icon, username, email, and password
- Option to upload a custom profile icon
- Tracked game statistics linked to users profile
- Ability to view user rankings based on game statistics
- Volume controls for music and sound effects
- Options to edit card size and card back (fully works as intended in Go Fish)
- Option to upload a custom card back image (not fully implemented)
- Option to change the background color
- Option to change resolution or enter full screen
- Ability to reset game statistics or delete account
- Goals to complete that are updated daily

For a more complete list of features, see our [Backlog](https://github.com/SeanCThomas0/CS307_cool_card_games/files/10263941/Backlog.pdf) (Note: while most of these features in the backlog our implemented, there may be a few that are not)

## What can be Improved in the Future?
While this is currently a working program, there are always things to improve upon. Here are some ideas that that could be implemented in the future:
- Improved implementation of chat
- Improved implementation of friends
- Complete multiplayer
- Complete achievements page
- Improved visuals and UI
- Use of profile icons and features within the card games
- Animations
- and more...

## About the Programmers
Jonathan Maskew, Isaac Stephan, Grant Larsen, Sean Thomas, Tommy Nguyen, Juan Diaz were active contributors to the project. At the time of development, each were Juniors in Computer Science at Purdue University.

Jonathan Maskew contributed Go Fish (and the AI to play against) as well as many customizability features. He implemented a card dealer class for the card games to utilize. He added the ability for card size to be change as well as the ability to select and upload custom card backs. He implemented the ability to change background colors. He also added a stats page to view from the profile. Lastly, he implemented the daily goals.

Isaac Stephan developed Euchre, Poker, and Bruh. Each of the games is equipped with difficulty options as well as an AI to play against. He also wrote the rules page, explaining how to play each of the card games.

Grant Larsen primarily integrated Firebase. He implemented authentication for the application. He also implemented statistic tracking in Firebase for each of the card games. He implemented the rankings based on these statistics, and worked on a tournaments feature. He also implemented the profile page, including the ability to change the icon, username, email, and password.

Sean Thomas added music and sound effects to the applications, including volume controls. He also worked towards implementing multiplayer.

Tommy Nguyen worked on chat and friend list features. He also implemented a contact page to allow users to contact us developers. Lastly, he implemented the resolution and full screen options.

Juan Diaz implemented Solitaire. In addition, he added the ablity to reset statics and delete an account. He also created the news page. He worked towards the ability to pause games, adding turn timers within games, viewing game rules withing the game, and implementing the achievements page.

## About  Development
Completed between August 2022 and December 2022. It was completed for a CS 307 at Purdue University. However, the idea, details, features, implementation, and code was decided independent of any course requirements. It was up to us to come up with a working product, and we completed it as a group from start to finish.

The project was completed following the scrum methodology. The semester was split into three sprints, and for each sprint a planning document as well as retrospective was completed. For sprints [2](https://github.com/SeanCThomas0/CS307_cool_card_games/files/10264124/Sprint.2.Testing.pdf) and [3](https://github.com/SeanCThomas0/CS307_cool_card_games/files/10264126/Sprint.3.Test.Cases.pdf), testing documents were completed as well.
