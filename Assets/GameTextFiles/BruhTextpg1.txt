Bruh Game rules

	Bruh is a card game that is unique to our application. It is a single player game where the goal is to get rid of all cards in your hand. While it is a single player game, there are computer players that can work to either trick or help you win the game. In this aspect the game is probably most similar to the card game Mao which requires a user to follow a certain set of rules to get rid of the cards in their hand. However, bruh is different in that it has different unwritten rules for the user to figure out, as well as a computer companion and computer opponent that change the dynamics of the game significantly. 
	The game begins when the computer opponent gives the player 7 cards to start with. The computer opponent then gives the user a comment that they can either follow or ignore. The player may choose to ignore the comment as the computer opponent chooses randomly whether to give the user helpful advice. The player plays one card, and the opponent either tells the user that it is a valid move, or that it is invalid, and the player will either have to just take their card back, or take their card back and pick up another card. In addition a user has a computer companion that they can use to give them advice and suggested moves that will always be correct. The only caveat is that if a user chooses to use the computer companion they must wait 3 moves to use it again. 
	The game finishes when a user wins and gets rid of all the cards in their hand, or they lose by amassing 20 or more cards in their hand.
