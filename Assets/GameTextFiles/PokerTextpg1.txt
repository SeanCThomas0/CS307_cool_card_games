Texas Hold 'em Poker Game Rules

	Texas Hold ‘em Poker is a poker variation that in this implementation can have between 2 and 6 players. Players each start with $150 of fake money to bet on the game with. The goal of the game is to be the player to either have the most money after a set number of rounds, or be the last player to have money. Money is represented in the game with different colored chips, and those chips are used to bet. 
	When a round begins one player is designated as the dealer who gives every player 2 cards, one player is designated as the small blind who has to bet $1 automatically, and the large blind who has to bet $2 automatically. These roles rotate to the left of the player circle after each hand. The small blind is the player to the left of the dealer and the large blind is the player to the left of the small blind. Note that if there are only 2 players in a game then each player bets $2 automatically. Then betting begins with the player to the left of the big blind. They can choose to bet any number of chips as long as they have that many chips, and each player gets a chance to match or raise those pre flop bets. If a player doesn’t want to play their hand or match a bet then they can choose to fold their hand and discard their two cards, this can be done at any time.
