Solitaire Game Rules

	\n\n\tSolitaire is a single player game that primarily focuses on sorting. The version we are using for our application is klondike solitaire. During the course of the game a player has to deal with four types of card piles: the tableau, the stock, the foundation, and the waste. The foundation is a set of four piles where each pile corresponds to a suit. 
	\n\tThe goal of the game is to sort cards of each suit from highest to lowest value, with ace being the lowest value, and king being the highest value. The game begins with many cards already dealt in the tableau and the stock holding the remaining cards face down. The player then must move cards into the foundation from the tableau in sequential order from lowest to highest based on the card suit. If no top cards that are flipped over in the tableau can be moved to the foundation a player can move already flipped over cards from stack to stack if the card is lower in value than the card it is going on top of and of opposite color. Then when a card is moved from a tableau column, if the card below it is not already flipped over, that card is flipped over to show its value. If a player has rearranged cards in the tableau and they can no longer move cards within the tableau or to the foundation then three cards from the stock can be moved to the waste. If the top card on the waste pile cannot be played then the user can deal out another 3 cards from the waste pile and put the previous 3 cards into the waste pile. 
	\n\tEventually if the user is able to work the cards around to organize them in the foundations from smallest to largest value then they win. If at a certain point no possible moves are available for the user make from the tableau or the waste then the player loses the game.
