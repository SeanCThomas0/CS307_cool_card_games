Euchre Rules:
Gameflow

     Euchre is a game played by 4 players, with two players each on opposing teams. The game only uses cards with default values from lowest to highest: 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace (value hierarchy explained in card values section). The first team to reach a score of 10 wins the game, and a player increases their score by winning a trick (which will be explained later). 
     Play begins when a dealer is chosen from one of the 4 players, cards are dealt to each player, and the remaining 4 cards (kitty) are placed in the middle of the table with the card on the top being flipped over. The players take turns, starting with the player to the left of the dealer, choosing whether to have the dealer pick up the top card that is displayed and replace it with a card in their hand, or pass the decision off to the next player in line. If a player decides to have the dealer pick up the card on the top of the kitty, the trump suit is set to that top card, the dealer picks it up and discards a card in their hand, and card play begins. If all players decide to pass and not have the dealer pick up the top card, then action begins again  to the left of the dealer with players deciding to either choose a trump suit or pass. If all players pass, the dealer must choose a suit. 
     Once a trump suit is chosen or top card is picked up players begin to play five tricks, with the winner of the hand gaining a point. Players take turns choosing 1 card to play, and the highest card out of the 4 cards played in a given trick wins that trick.
