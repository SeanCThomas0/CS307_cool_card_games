The player plays one card, and the opponent either tells the user that it is a valid move, or that it is invalid, and the player will either have to just take their card back, or take their card back and pick up another card. In addition a user has a computer companion that they can use to give them advice and suggested moves that will always be correct. The only caveat is that if a user chooses to use the computer companion they must wait 3 moves to use it again. 
	The game finishes when a user wins and gets rid of all the cards in their hand, or they lose by amassing 20 or more cards in their hand.
