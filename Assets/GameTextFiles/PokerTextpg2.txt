Once all players that are still playing have matched the top bet 3 cards are dealt off the top of the remaining deck. Players can then choose to check (not bet) and move the choice to the next player, or bet based on the cards shown. Again players can fold if they donâ€™t want to match a raised bet. Once all players have matched the bet then another card is taken off the top of the deck and shown. Betting/folding happens again and then the final card is played off the top of the deck. The final round of betting then begins, and if there is more than one player left in after betting has concluded then the players left in show the cards in their hand and a winner is determined. If at any time during play all players fold but one then that player wins the hand and gets to talk the money in the pot that holds all bets for the round. 
	There are a number of different card combinations that are used to determine which player won. If two or more players tie for the win then the pot is split. Otherwise the hierarchy for card combination wins is as follows for the top 7 card combinations a user may make from highest to lowest: 1. Royal flush 2. straight flush 3. four of a kind 4. full house 5. flush 6. straight 7. three of a kind 8. two pairs 9. single pair 10. highest card.
